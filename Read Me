Smart Sorting project using transfer learning, suitable for deployment in food processing plants, supermarkets, or smart home fridges.
This code includes:

Training the model (using EfficientNetB0 as a feature extractor)

Prediction script (for real-time or batch image classification)

Instructions for integration with cameras or apps.


+++Integration with Camera or App
For Food Processing Plant or Supermarket
Camera Integration:

Use OpenCV to capture images from a camera.

Pass each image to predict_image() for classification.

Integrate with a sorting mechanism (e.g., robotic arm) to remove rotten produce.

For Smart Home Fridge
Fridge Camera:

Use a Raspberry Pi with a camera module.

Run predict.py periodically to check stored produce.

Send alerts to a smartphone app using MQTT or a web API.

5. Deployment
Web App: Use Flask or Django to build a web interface for uploading images and displaying results.

Mobile App: Use TensorFlow Lite to convert the model and deploy on Android/iOS.

Cloud: Deploy the model on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable processing.
